# Spam_Text_Classification1
This project focuses on building a spam message classification system using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The process includes key steps: preprocessing text data, creating a dictionary, converting messages into feature vectors, training the model with data split into train/validation/test sets, and finally evaluating and predicting new messages.
